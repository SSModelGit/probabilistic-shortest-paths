# probabilistic-shortest-paths
Implementation of shortest path algorithms considering uncertainty

## Example 1: Grid World Example
The implementation is located in the [grid-world-ex](grid-world-ex/) sub-folder. The basis of the implementation derives from the example in Chapter 4 of the book Decision Making Under Uncertainty, by Mykel J. Kochenderfer.
